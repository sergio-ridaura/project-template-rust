# ðŸ”§ Action Plan v25.6.25

_Copyright (c) 2025. [Sergio Ridaura](https://github.com/sergio-ridaura)._

## Project Template

Base template to start Rust projects quickly and efficiently.

Setting up a project from scratch can be a complex, repetitive, and error-prone task. This initial process consumes valuable time that could be dedicated to developing key features. To address this challenge, we propose a base template that simplifies and optimizes the initial project setup, promoting best practices from the start.

This template is designed to be used with **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** and integrates seamlessly with **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, making it easy to create repositories and manage source code. By adopting this predefined structure, development teams can focus on what really matters: building innovative, high-quality solutions.

## Tasks

The fundamental purpose of this action plan is to provide a robust foundation that streamlines the creation of repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The goal is to simplify initial setup, standardize processes, and encourage best practices from the start of the project. The following tasks are to be executed:
