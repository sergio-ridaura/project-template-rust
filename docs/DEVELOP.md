The development of projects using this base template is designed to be efficient, structured, and professional. The template incorporates best practices and recognized methodologies such as **[GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/get-started/using-github/github-flow)** and **[Kanban](https://asana.com/resources/what-is-kanban)**, ensuring a collaborative and organized workflow.

### Initial Setup

After installing the base template, it is essential to follow a series of steps to properly configure the project and ensure efficient development. This guide provides the necessary instructions to effectively lay the groundwork for your work.

Details about the installation steps can be found in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) document, which includes clear and precise instructions for setting up the development environment. Be sure to follow each step carefully to avoid issues and ensure the environment is ready to start development.

#### Defining Objectives

Customize the [PROPOSAL.md](PROPOSAL.md) document to clearly and precisely define the objectives and scope of the project. This step is fundamental to ensure that all team members are aligned and understand the established goals.

Before starting development, make sure you have a well-structured proposal approved by the development team. This not only facilitates planning but also minimizes misunderstandings and ensures a coherent approach.

Keep in mind that the initial proposal may evolve as the project progresses. Therefore, it is crucial to keep it updated and review it periodically to reflect necessary changes and adaptations.

Remember that this document is a starting point that you can adapt according to the specific needs of your project. Adjust the sections and details to reflect the unique nature of your team and development goals.

#### Stage Planning

Use the [ACTION_PLAN.md](ACTION_PLAN.md) document to structure the implementation phases of the project and assign specific responsibilities to each team member.

Each stage should be clearly defined, including concrete objectives, established deadlines, and necessary resources. This ensures an organized approach and allows you to anticipate possible challenges, facilitating the planning of effective solutions.

Also, review and update the action plan periodically to reflect the project's progress and adapt to unexpected changes, ensuring execution aligned with the established objectives.

Depending on the complexity of the project, consider dividing it into milestones or partial deliveries. This strategy facilitates progress tracking and allows for continuous adjustments and improvements, ensuring the project advances in a controlled manner and aligned with the established objectives.

Whenever possible, record the start and end dates of each cycle directly on the Kanban board. This makes it easier to track progress and analyze the actual duration of cycles versus what was planned.

If the team works with a defined calendar, also note the estimated start and end dates for each task. Ensure these dates are realistic and useful for prioritizing your work, establishing blocking dates that allow the necessary time to be dedicated to each task strictly and focused.

If you notice that planned dates are often not met or objectives are not achieved, review the workflow and adjust the planning to better fit the team's capacity and dynamics.

Additionally, you can enrich each task with additional information, such as labels, required resources, success criteria, and possible risks. This provides a more complete view of the project, helps identify bottlenecks, and allows you to anticipate challenges, optimizing planning and execution.

#### Task Management

Adapt the [KANBAN.md](KANBAN.md) document to organize project tasks visually and efficiently, using a Kanban approach. This method allows you to manage workflow by moving tasks between columns representing their current status, such as "Pending," "To Do," "In Progress," "Blocked," and "Completed."

To optimize management, include key information in each task, such as start and end dates, assigned responsible persons, and involved teams. This provides a clear view of progress and responsibilities, facilitating coordination and tracking.

The Kanban approach helps identify bottlenecks in the process, allowing quick adjustments to improve team efficiency. It also fosters transparency and collaboration, ensuring all members are aligned with project objectives.

#### Version Control

Use the [.gitignore](.gitignore) file to prevent unnecessary files from being included in version control.

#### GitHub Files

Customize the GitHub configuration files to optimize collaboration and change tracking in your project. These configurations help standardize processes, improve communication among collaborators, and ensure a more efficient workflow.

#### Visual Studio Code Configuration

Configure Visual Studio Code files to suit the specific needs of your project. Be sure to include common settings, such as code formatting rules, recommended extensions, and workspace adjustments. This ensures all developers work with the same tools and settings, promoting consistency and efficiency in development.

#### Project License

Select and adapt the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) document to define the appropriate license for the project, ensuring copyright and usage conditions are respected.

This step is crucial to establish the project's legal foundations and ensure all collaborators understand their rights and responsibilities. Be sure to choose a license that aligns with the project's goals and encourages open collaboration, if desired.

#### Project Documentation

Update the [README.md](README.md) document to reflect the current state of the project and provide a clear overview.

Include links to other relevant documents, such as [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), [DEVELOP.md](DEVELOP.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and any other resources that may be useful for developers and collaborators.

Ensure that [README.md](README.md) is easy to understand and provides a clear introduction to the project, its objectives, and how to contribute. This document is the first impression new collaborators will have, so it should be informative and accessible.

#### Code of Conduct

Customize the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document to establish a clear and professional code of conduct, promoting a respectful and collaborative work environment.

This code of conduct should include guidelines on expected team member behavior, how to handle conflicts, and how to foster an inclusive environment. It is essential that all team members commit to following these guidelines to ensure effective and harmonious collaboration.

#### Collaboration

Customize the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document to define the team's contribution and collaboration guidelines, ensuring an efficient workflow.

This document should include clear instructions on how developers can contribute to the project, from creating branches to submitting pull requests. It is essential that all team members understand and follow these guidelines to maintain an organized and coherent development process.

#### Text Quality

Configure the [cspell.json](cspell.json) file to maintain text quality in project documents, avoiding spelling errors.

#### Environment Setup

Modify the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) document to provide clear instructions for installing and configuring the development environment.

Be sure to include all necessary steps so developers can effectively set up their local environment, including dependencies, tools, and specific configurations.

#### Development Guide

Adjust the [DEVELOP.md](DEVELOP.md) document as a reference for development in a local environment, ensuring all developers follow the same practices and configurations.

This document should include details on how to run the project locally, perform tests, and apply good coding practices. It is essential that all team members have access to this guide to ensure consistent and efficient development.

#### Deployment Guide

Adapt the [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) document to provide a clear guide on how to deploy the project to a production environment. This document should include detailed steps on environment setup, code deployment, and necessary tests to ensure a successful deployment.

#### Security

Adapt the [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) document to include clear guidelines on how to identify, report, and manage security vulnerabilities. Be sure to provide detailed information on available communication channels, expected response times, and best practices to ensure the integrity and protection of the project.
