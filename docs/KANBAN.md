## Project Template Rust

Base template to quickly and efficiently start Rust projects.

A structured foundation for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) projects that incorporates good practices and recognized methodologies, ensuring efficient and organized development.

### Backlog

_Currently there are no tasks in this section._

### To Do

- **Rust Dockerfile**: Create a `Dockerfile` for the Rust project, ensuring that the development environment is consistent and easy to set up. This `Dockerfile` should include necessary dependencies and project-specific configurations.

- **Hello World! Rust**: Create a Rust project that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. This basic exercise will serve as a starting point to verify that the development environment is properly configured and working.

- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Configure GitHub Actions to implement a CI/CD workflow that runs tests and automatically deploys the Rust project. This will ensure that code is tested and deployed efficiently and reliably.

- **Publish Project to Crates.io**: Publish the project to [Crates.io](https://crates.io/) to make it available to the Rust community. This will allow other developers to use and contribute to the project, fostering collaboration and community growth.

### In Progress

### Completed

- **GitHub Repository Setup**: Set up a GitHub repository to manage version control, based on the [Project Template](https://github.com/sergio-ridaura/project-template) base template.

- **Base Template Adaptation**: Starting from the [Project Template](https://github.com/sergio-ridaura/project-template) base template, the purpose is to accelerate and optimize the startup of new software projects.
