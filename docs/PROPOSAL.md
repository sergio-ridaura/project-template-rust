## Project Template

Base template to start Rust projects quickly and efficiently.

### Introduction

Setting up a project from scratch can be a complex, repetitive, and error-prone task. This initial process consumes valuable time that could be dedicated to developing key features. To address this challenge, we propose a base template that simplifies and optimizes the initial project setup, promoting best practices from the start.

This template is designed to be used with **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** and integrates seamlessly with **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, making it easy to create repositories and manage source code. By adopting this predefined structure, development teams can focus on what really matters: building innovative, high-quality solutions.

### Objectives

1. **Streamline initial setup**: Reduce the time and effort required to start a project.
2. **Promote best practices**: Incorporate recognized methodologies such as **[GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)** and **[Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban)**.
3. **Facilitate collaboration**: Seamless integration with GitHub for efficient code management and teamwork.
4. **Reduce common errors**: Provide a predefined structure that minimizes errors in the initial stages.

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Save time by avoiding repetitive tasks.
- **Standardization**: Use of a consistent and proven structure.
- **Collaboration**: Improved team communication and organization.
- **Scalability**: Solid foundation for projects of any size.

### Key Features

1. **GitHub Integration**: Optimized code management and support for collaborative workflows.
2. **Visual Studio Code Integration**: Ready-to-use setup, including recommended extensions and custom configurations.
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes detailed guides for installation, development, deployment, contributions, and more.
4. **Recognized Methodologies**: Utilizes practices such as GitHub Flow and Kanban for structured development.

### Conclusion

This base template represents a comprehensive solution to start projects efficiently, in a structured and professional manner. By adopting this proposal, development teams will be able to focus on what really matters: building innovative, high-quality solutions.
