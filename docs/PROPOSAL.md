## Project Template Rust

Base template to quickly and efficiently start Rust projects.

### Introduction

Setting up a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) project from scratch can be a complex, repetitive, and error-prone task. This initial process consumes valuable time that could be dedicated to developing key functionalities. To address this challenge, we propose a base template that simplifies and optimizes the initial project configuration, promoting good practices from the beginning.

This template is designed to be used with **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** and integrates seamlessly with **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, facilitating repository creation and source code management. By adopting this predefined structure, development teams can focus on what really matters: building innovative and high-quality solutions.

### Objectives

1. **Streamline initial setup**: Reduce the time and effort required to start a project.
2. **Promote good practices**: Incorporate recognized methodologies such as **[GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)** and **[Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban)**.
3. **Facilitate collaboration**: Seamless integration with GitHub for efficient code management and teamwork.
4. **Reduce common errors**: Provide a predefined structure that minimizes errors in the initial stages.

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Time savings by avoiding repetitive tasks.
- **Standardization**: Use of a consistent and proven structure.
- **Collaboration**: Improved team communication and organization.
- **Scalability**: Solid foundation for projects of any size.

### Key Features

1. **GitHub Integration**: Optimized code management and support for collaborative workflows.
2. **Visual Studio Code Integration**: Ready-to-use configuration, including recommended extensions and custom settings.
3. **Dockerized Environment**: Provides a preconfigured Docker container that ensures a consistent development environment for Rust.
4. **Predefined Rust Project Structure**: Clear organization of folders and files, facilitating code navigation and maintenance.
5. **CI/CD Configuration**: Integration with continuous integration and continuous deployment tools to automate testing and deployments.
6. **Complete Documentation**: Includes detailed guides for installation, development, deployment, contributions, and more.
7. **Recognized Methodologies**: Use of practices such as GitHub Flow and Kanban for structured development.

### Conclusion

This base template represents a comprehensive solution for starting Rust projects efficiently, in a structured and professional manner. By adopting this proposal, development teams will be able to focus on what really matters: building innovative and high-quality solutions.
