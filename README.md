# Project Template Rust v25.6.27

_Copyright (c) 2025. [Sergio Ridaura](https://github.com/sergio-ridaura)._

A base template to quickly and efficiently start Rust projects.

Setting up a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) project from scratch can be complex, repetitive, and error-prone. This initial process consumes valuable time that could be better spent developing key features. To address this challenge, we propose a base template that simplifies and streamlines the initial project setup, promoting best practices from the start.

This template is designed to be used with **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** and integrates seamlessly with **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, making it easy to create repositories and manage source code. By adopting this predefined structure, development teams can focus on what truly matters: building innovative and high-quality solutions.
