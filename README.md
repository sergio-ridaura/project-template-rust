# Project Template v25.6.25

_Copyright (c) 2025. [Sergio Ridaura](https://github.com/sergio-ridaura)._

Base template for starting software projects quickly and efficiently.

Setting up a project from scratch can be a complex, repetitive, and error-prone task. This initial process consumes valuable time that could be dedicated to developing key features. To address this challenge, we propose a base template that simplifies and streamlines the initial project setup, promoting best practices from the start.

This template is designed to be used with **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** and integrates seamlessly with **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, making it easy to create repositories and manage source code. By adopting this predefined structure, development teams can focus on what really matters: building innovative and high-quality solutions.
